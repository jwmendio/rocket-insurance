## Notes

- On the Notion instructions, only first and last name are required. However, when making an API call, it requires the address be included. Thus, I made the form require the user enter a first name, last name, and address (line 1, city, region, postal).

- The instructions seem to imply that the two screens be on two separate endpoints. However, I personally think it'd be better if the two forms be combined into a two-step form living under one endpoint since there is no GET endpoint to fetch the data for the second form. Without a GET endpoint, if the user refreshes the page while on the second form, the data cannot be rehydrated.
